# College Programs
This repository has been made with the purpose of preserving the programs that were made by me during the course of my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering.

Since the purpose of this repository is **preservation**, the code presented here is structured as folders with standalone source code files which haven't been altered or modified from their original writing.
Sample inputs are also provided wherever applicable.

Feel free to browse through the repository and the code.

## Gradle Tasks
In order to simplify the process of getting any of these samples up and running, I've added gradle tasks wherever possible to run the commands and see the output.
A gradle wrapper has been provided, so all you would need to do is run the appropriate `gradlew` command and the program will compile and run.
The `--quiet` flag has been added in order to suppress Gradle's own output which interferes with the programs' I/O.

**Note:** The first time you run the `gradlew`, the Gradle v3.5 distribution would be downloaded. Hence it would take some time to execute.
If you wish to see the download progress during that first time execution, ensure you remove the `--quiet` flag from the command.
